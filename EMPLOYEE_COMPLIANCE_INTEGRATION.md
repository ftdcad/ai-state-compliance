# Employee Compliance Integration

## Added from compliance-and-legal-hub

This repository now includes Employee Compliance Tracking features consolidated from the `compliance-and-legal-hub` repository.

### Files Added:

**Frontend Component:**
- `src/components/employee-compliance/EmployeeComplianceView.tsx` - Employee license/bond tracking by state

**Backend Models:**
- `server/src/models/License.ts` - License tracking model with employee assignment
- `server/src/models/Bond.ts` - Bond tracking model with employee assignment

**Backend API Routes:**
- `server/src/routes/licenses.ts` - CRUD operations for licenses
- `server/src/routes/bonds.ts` - CRUD operations for bonds

### Features:

**Employee Compliance View:**
- Track which employees are licensed in which states
- Track bonds by employee and state
- Expiration status tracking (Active, Expiring Soon, Expired)
- Color-coded badges for status
- Filter by state
- Group licenses/bonds by employee
- Summary stats (Total Employees, Active Licenses, Expiring Soon, Expired)

### Integration with CCS Employee Portal:

This consolidated codebase is ready to be integrated into the main `coastalclaims-employee-portal` as the AI Compliance section with:

1. **State Browser** (from original ai-state-compliance) - Browse Coastal's 35 licensed states
2. **Employee Compliance** (from compliance-and-legal-hub) - Track employee licenses/bonds

### Repositories to Delete:

Once integration is complete, these repositories can be safely deleted:
- ❌ `compliance-and-legal-hub` - Employee tracking features now consolidated here
- ❌ `compliance-legal-2` - Admin-focused, not needed
